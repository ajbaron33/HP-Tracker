# Monster HP Tracker

A simple, lightweight **Monster HP Tracker** for tabletop RPGs (like D&D 5e).  
Runs directly in the browser — no backend, no installs required.

## ✨ Features

- Add monsters with **Name, Max HP, AC**, and optional thumbnail image.
- Track **damage and healing** quickly.
- Monster cards automatically show **Bloodied** and **Dead** states.
  - Dead monsters display with a **red ❌ over their thumbnail**.
- Apply, view, and clear **status conditions**.
- Edit any monster’s details (Name, HP, AC, Image) after creation.
- Delete monsters (with confirmation prompt).
- **Persistent storage**: monsters are saved in `localStorage` so your data survives page refreshes.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
